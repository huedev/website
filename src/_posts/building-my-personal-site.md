Hey, welcome! I've been meaning to build a personal site for a while now, and with everything going on with Twitter, I'm happy to finally have my own little space on the internet.

My first job out of college was my introduction to web development, and I enjoyed it a lot and hope to do more with the web in the future. I see this site as my first step towards cultivating a more healthy life online, relying less on whims of companies and embracing a return to the internet as it used to be, owned by individuals and grass-roots communities.

I'm still figuring out what I want this site to be, but I plan on showing updates about projects that I'm working on and talking about things I'm interested in, such as games, the web, and pixel art. Ideally, I hope to write a post once a month, but I don't want to force it and take the fun out of it for myself if I don't have anything to say.

To cap things off for now, I'll just say that I'm currently working on my game, Knifemare. I had taken a long break from working on it after being unhappy with the gameplay and story, so I am scaling back the narrative elements to focus more on refining the game's mechanics. Progress is going well, and I hope to have something to show soon!

Thanks for stopping by!
